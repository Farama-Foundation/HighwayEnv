    Interface for A goal-based environment.

    This interface is needed by agents such as Stable Baseline3's Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) agent.
    It was originally part of https://github.com/openai/gym, but was later moved
    to https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-robotics. We cannot add gym-robotics to this project's dependencies,
    since it does not have an official PyPi package, PyPi does not allow direct dependencies to git repositories.
    So instead, we just reproduce the interface here.

    A goal-based environment. It functions just as any regular OpenAI Gym environment but it
    imposes a required structure on the observation_space. More concretely, the observation
    space is required to contain at least three elements, namely `observation`, `desired_goal`, and
    `achieved_goal`. Here, `desired_goal` specifies the goal that the agent should attempt to achieve.
    `achieved_goal` is the goal that it currently achieved instead. `observation` contains the
    actual observations of the environment as per usual.
